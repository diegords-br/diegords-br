[Clothing:](https://github.com/diegords-br/Clothing_Store_Project)
* A clothing company wants to increase its profit for the next year. It has a mobile app and a website, which the customer can access, choose their clothes and make their purchase. The company is deciding whether to focus its workouts on its mobile app experience or its website. For this, help is sought from a data scientist to help with the task. The following project shows a possible solution to this issue.

[Accident Analysis](https://github.com/diegords-br/Accident_Analysis)
* If you run a business, you will likely have people driving vehicles, even if you don't operate in trucks or transportation niches. Over and over again, employees will have to take trips, go out to meet customers, or for any other reason. While driving a company vehicle has many benefits for employees, there is always a risk involved. They can be involved in accidents, either through their own fault or through the negligence of other drivers. Whatever the reason for the accident, you can get into a difficult situation as a vehicle owner. This project is an analysis of data from accidents on Brazilian highways in the year 2019.
