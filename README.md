<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Diego Renan</h1>
<h2 align="center">A passionate Data Scientist and PhD candidate in Physics from Brazil</h2>

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Physics and Data Scientist at Risknow. I have a solid background in data analysis and the creation of machine learning models because of my experience in real estate credit and my current professional certification in machine learning by IBM. My academic profile gives me great experience in solving problems using analytic skills using scientific methodology. Furthermore, my experience as a teacher gives me great habilities in communication and the power of synthesis.

I have large experience in cloud services using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and your tools such as Athena, SageMaker, S3, and QuickSight. I use Python and R as my programming languages. I have experience in the ETL process using SQL language for databases and to manipulate big data I use Pyspark. For the creation of machine learning models, I use Scikit-Learn and for deep learning, I use Keras and Tensor Flow for the creation of Neural networks. For data visualization/dashboards, I use Power BI, Python, and your libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Furthermore, for code versioning, I use GitLab and GitHub.

[Clothing:](https://github.com/diegords-br/Clothing_Store_Project)
* A clothing company wants to increase its profit for the next year. It has a mobile app and a website, which the customer can access, choose their clothes and make their purchase. The company is deciding whether to focus its workouts on its mobile app experience or its website. For this, help is sought from a data scientist to help with the task. The following project shows a possible solution to this issue.

[Accident Analysis](https://github.com/diegords-br/Accident_Analysis)
* If you run a business, you will likely have people driving vehicles, even if you don't operate in trucks or transportation niches. Over and over again, employees will have to take trips, go out to meet customers, or for any other reason. While driving a company vehicle has many benefits for employees, there is always a risk involved. They can be involved in accidents, either through their own fault or through the negligence of other drivers. Whatever the reason for the accident, you can get into a difficult situation as a vehicle owner. This project is an analysis of data from accidents on Brazilian highways in the year 2019.
